Modular async trend-following framework for cryptocurrency strategy research and backtesting

This project implements a high-performance backtesting and signal research framework for crypto trading strategies, with an emphasis on trend-following and momentum-based alpha generation. Built with modular architecture and asynchronous data ingestion from Binance Futures, it supports rapid development and evaluation of multiple strategies, including:

Bollinger Bands z-score mean reversion

Multi-horizon moving average crossovers (SMA, EMA)

Weighted EMA signals with Sharpe-optimized ensemble weighting

Portfolio-level volatility targeting and execution cost simulation

Cross-sectional regression analysis of signal quality

Performance reporting (Sharpe, Calmar, drawdown)
